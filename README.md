# Jenna Car Portfolio

Hello!  Welcome to the read me file of my final portfolio.  Below, you will find detailed information on my progress completing this assignment, as well as the resources.

## Project Description
For my final assignment I am designing a website for my made-up company "Digi-Art".  I have been working on designing the branding for this company throughout the entire semester, in both my UX class and my CMS class.  With this project, I want to show my ability to create a website with an easy to navigate layout, that also demonstrates my passion for UI design and my capabilties to make things look good.

### The Process

During the process there were a few challenges faced, one of them being the process of creating a navbar with bootstrap, however I was able to communicate with a classmate and receive some help which made completing the task easier.

Another challenge faced along the way was an issue with the navbars lists css being carried over to the footers lists, which I did not want.  I was able to use the GitHub Issues and ask the teacher for assistance, which solved the problem.

A third challenge faced along the way was the banner image not being the full width of the screen.  I once again used GitHub Issues to ask the teacher and recieved feedback which allowed me to fix the issue.

A fourth challenge was my skip links not working, which was because of a bad spelling mistake.

#### Reflection

After this semester of web dev, I am confident to say I have been able to improve drastically from the first semester, where I was struggling quite a bit, and I was always extremely stressed about the assignments.  Now, I am able to create a website much faster and better then last semester, without stressing too much.

So far, this final assignment is the smoothest assignment I have done in web dev, even though it may be the most difficult.  I also believe it is the best looking website I have created, which i am quite happy about.
